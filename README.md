agorava-tripit
==============

An effort to create a Agorava implementation for TripIt Oauth service.

Agorava
=======
[Agorava](http://agorava.org) is the missing framework to deal with Social Media based on OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0. It provides a way to authenticate on Social Media, use APIs and map JSON answers to Java pojo. It’ll have multiple implementations (like CDI, Java SE, JSR 330 supporting framework and others) to support your needs. Right now the only implementation is based on CDI but we’ll provide others in the coming months.
